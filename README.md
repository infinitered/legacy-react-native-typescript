# legacy-react-native-typescript

Here's some react-native typescript typings of yester-year.

Forked from `@types/react-native`, slightly tweaked and frozen in time.

You'll want to link in your package.json like this:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react-native": "infinitered/legacy-react-native-typescript#493-geolocation"
  }
}
```

Chances are you don't want to be using this repo.
